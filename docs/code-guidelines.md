We recommend to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Eslint
We using [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) with the [namics eslint-config](https://github.com/namics/eslint-config-namics).

## Prettier
We using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code formatting. You can add an [atom-plugin](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom) or [vscode-plugin](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) to run prettier in your ide.

## Unit Tests
We using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for unit testing and the coverage should be higher than 90%.
The coverage will be reported and checked before commit.
